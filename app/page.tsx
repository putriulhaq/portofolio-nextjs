            Hi there! Welcome, and thank you for visiting this page! 
              I&apos;am Ulhaq and currently working as a software engineer, mostly doing fullstack development. Honestly, Iam really eager to dive deeper into 
              backend development that&apos;s where my inrterest lies.
              I&apos;ve been working with Python, PHP, NodeJs, Javascript and recently Iâ€™ve started exploring Go,
              which has been super exciting. Outside of coding, Iâ€™m a big fan of sportsâ€”pretty much any kind! 
              Running, badminton, or just anything activeâ€”itâ€™s my way of staying balance, let&apos;s connect!&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;ðŸ˜Š
